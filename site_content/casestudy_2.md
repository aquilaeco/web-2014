Due to the presence of a large population of the threatened plant, *Tetratheca glaundulosa* and a range of other listed species, a species impact statement was prepared for PF Formation's proposal to expand sand extraction activities at Maroota.  To mitigate impacts the core area of the population was set aside and a rehabilitation plan for the affected areas was prepared by Footprint Green Pty Ltd.
