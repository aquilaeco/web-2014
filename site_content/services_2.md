AES can undertake flora surveys on the small to large scale with methods appropriate to the size and scale of the project.  As well as targeted searches for rare and threatened flora species, we can assay  vegetation communities using quadrat sampling, random menader, linear transects and  other methods.  We can also provide vegetation mapping of your site using a combination of on-ground sampling and remote sensing methods.
